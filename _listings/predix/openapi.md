    post:
      summary: Deploy an analytic with an optional deployment configuration by analytic
        catalog entry id.
      description: This operation FORCE deploys the specified analytic into the Cloud
        Foundry environment with an optional deployment configuration, responds with
        the request id (generated for the request), and the current request status.  The
        force deploy usually takes longer than the standard timeout, so the calling
        process should use the returned request id to monitor the request status and
        to retrieve the deployment results.
